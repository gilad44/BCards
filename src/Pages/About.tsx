        BCard is a modern business card management web application. It allows
        users to create, edit, and manage digital business cards, as well as
        browse and favorite cards from others. The project was developed using
        React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Flowbite React for UI components.
        Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, and form validation uses Joi. The
        app demonstrates best practices in component-based architecture, state
        management, and responsive design.
